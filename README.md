This is a CLI tool that allows you to check for the host, theme and other relevant information about a website.
The tool is written in Python and uses hostio and some other free APIs as I don't intend to make many requests so I opted for such APIs.

Feel free to customize and edit the code as you see fit. This tool was only made for me and I was its only intended user but in the future I do intend to extend its functionality.

To use this tool, start the executor.py file
py executor.py

The APIs Used for this tool are:
Domain Age: whois-lookup-api (rapidapi.com)
Host Iformation: Host.io 
Website Technology: Whatcms.org
WordPress Theme Info: Themedetect.com
Page Speed Info: Google Pagespeed Insights, Method: pagespeedapi.runpagespeed,(pagespeedonline.googleapis.com)
