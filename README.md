This is a CLI tool that allows you to check for the host, theme and other relevant information about a website.
The tool is written in Python and uses hostio and some other free APIs as I don't intend to make many requests so I opted for such APIs.

Feel free to customize and edit the code as you see fit. This tool was only made for me and I was its only intended user but in the future I do intend to extend its functionality.
